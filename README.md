PySoFlo Meetup Notes / Presentations / Samples
##############################################

Feel free to contribute in every meetup. If you have a presentation or a
project that you would like to show off, you can simply setup a folder for
the meetup and a quick description for that. 

Notes
=====

Most of the docs are written in markdown and can be taken by anyone.

Presentations
=============

Topics are created before the meetups are scheduled and anyone has an
opportunity to participate in a discussion of their choosing.

Hackathons
==========

Sometimes we enjoy doing hackathons, so if there is something you've been
really wanting to work on we should be apart of that! **:)**

Meetups
=======

All python south florida meetups are scheduled for the **2nd Friday of
Every Month** and you can check it out on:
